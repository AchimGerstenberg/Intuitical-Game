# Intuitical-Game

Use the mouse to bring the red dot into the black square as fast as possible.

The mouse position or movement influences the movement of the red dot but it is not immediately obvious what the relation between mouse and red dot movement is.

How do humans recognize patterns? <br>
Are there behvioural patterns when the players intuitively play? <br>
How does intuitive learning compare with analytically testing hypothesis and conciously finding the relation between mouse and red dot movement?<br>
To study the game performance and the player's performance the mouse movements, movement of the red dot and the game performance is recorded in text files. I included two of these tab separated text files as an example.

Feel free to just play the game for fun or use it for research. If you have questions or are interested in getting data points and study learning behavior please send an email to Achim.Gerstenberg@ntnu.no.<br>
